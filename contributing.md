# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure your contribution is useful and relevant before submitting.
- Always search for previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may produce duplicate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Links must be pointing directly to the repository, no tracking links allowed. This list is not for advertising purposes.
- Non-repository link can be acceptable ONLY if the contribution is a non open source.


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.


Thank you for your suggestions!
