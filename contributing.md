# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure your contribution is useful and relevant before submitting.
- As much as possible, your contribution is up to date.
- Always search for previous contribution before making a new one, as yours may produce duplicate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Keep descriptions short, simple and always end with a period.
- Order link titles alphabetically within each category.
- Links must be pointing directly to the repository, no tracking links allowed. This list is not for advertising purposes.
- Try to make your pull request and title as descriptive as possible.
- New categories is always welcome. Improvements to the existing categories or this repository itself are always welcome too.


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.


Thank you for your suggestions!
